# nano-blog
a simple dotnetcore blog implementation

## motivation

#### explore dotnetcore features
dotnetcore is beautiful and multiplatform implementation of .NET, besides it's sweet to developing using C# language, so I pretend use aspnetcore technology to bring this project to life.

#### use a minimal and simple technology stack to support this nano platform
I pretend to force this project to use a minimal and simple technology stack, this project must consume almost nothing to live.
